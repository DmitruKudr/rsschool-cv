### Profile
A productive and purposeful student at BSUIR in the field of frontend development with the ability to assimilate new material and finding solutions in completing interesting tasks. I always try to keep up with up-to-date technologies, study them and apply them in my projects for subsequent code optimization.

I've been learning JavaScript in conjunction with React throughout the year. Completed C, C# and Web development courses of BelHard IT company. Also, I took part in NearCrowd project writing algorithms using CrowdScript programming language for AI learning.

### Skills
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- TypeScript
- React
- Redux, Mobx
- C, C++
- Git, GitHub

### Code example
__Strip Comments (4th kyu Codewars kata):__ Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.
```javascript
function solution(input, markers) {
  return input.split("\n").map(str => {
        let result;
        for(let marker of markers) {
            if(str.includes(marker)) result = str.slice(0, str.indexOf(marker)).trim()
        }
        return typeof(result) == 'undefined' ? str : result;
    }).join("\n");
};
```

### Experience
In university, I completed an extensive project named "Car Shop" written in C++, in which I delved into the intricacies of object-oriented programming (OOP) and file handling. Additionally, I developed a web store website, both from the front-end using React as main library and back-end perspectives.
